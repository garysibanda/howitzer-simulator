# M777 Howitzer Artillery Simulation

Enhanced physics-based artillery simulation featuring the M777 155mm howitzer with realistic ballistics calculations.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics**: Altitude-dependent gravity, air density, and drag coefficients
- **Interactive Controls**: Keyboard controls for aiming and firing
- **Visual Effects**: Projectile trails and muzzle flash animations
- **Accurate Ballistics**: Mach number calculations and atmospheric modeling
- **Hit Detection**: Target scoring with accuracy statistics

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Adjust howitzer elevation and direction
- **Spacebar**: Fire projectile
- **Automatic**: New terrain generated after each hit

## Technical Improvements

- Fixed critical constructor bugs in physics classes
- Enhanced memory management with proper destructors
- Comprehensive operator overloading for math classes
- Improved error handling and validation
- Better game statistics and user feedback

## Build Requirements

- macOS with Xcode
- OpenGL.framework
- GLUT.framework
